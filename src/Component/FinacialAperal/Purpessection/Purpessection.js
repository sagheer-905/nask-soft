      <p>Appraisals may be commissioned for a variety of reasons, based on any number of unique
        circumstances.
        Broadly speaking, however, these reports are commissioned because one (or more) stakeholders
        require(s) a fair
        and unbiased estimate of an asset’s value.</p>
      <h6 className="fw-bold mb-3 inner-heading">Circumstances that may require an appraisal include:</h6>
      <p>To facilitate a transaction involving a specific asset – Both the buyer and the seller need to
        understand what the
        asset’s estimated value is to help negotiate a clearing price.</p>
      <ul>
        <li className="mb-2"><span className="fw-bold">To secure financing – </span>Particularly credit. Financial
          institutions generally lend some loan-to-value (LTV)
          against different asset classes, so they require an estimate of value before extending
          credit.
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2"><span className="fw-bold">To take out an insurance policy against an asset – </span>Insurance companies cannot assign a policy value to an asset 
          without understanding what the asset is worth or what it would cost to replace. 
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2"><span className="fw-bold">For will and estate planning – </span>Families, as well as their lawyers and wealth advisors, may wish to
          better understand what assets are worth in order to support the division of those assets among beneficiaries. 
        </li>
        <li className="mb-2"><span className="fw-bold">“Disputes” – </span>It’s common when shareholders in a private business have some sort of dispute around control
          of a company; an independent valuation of that business may be required in order to facilitate a buy-out.
          Divorce and/or separation is a similar justification for seeking the valuation of assets, including a private
          business (or businesses). 
        </li>
        <li><span className="fw-bold">For tax purposes – </span>An example is if an asset is being donated to a non-profit organization; the “value” of that asset 
          could be tax deductible for the donor, but a fair and objective estimate of value is required. In the US, the Internal
          Revenue Service (IRS) requires what’s called a Qualified Appraisal in this instance, the standards of which are higher 
          than for most other appraisal circumstances.

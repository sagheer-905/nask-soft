                    <p>A budget is a document businesses use to track income and expenses in a detailed enough way to
                        make operational decisions. Budgets are typically forward-looking in nature. Income is based on
                        projections and estimates for the periods they cover, as are expenses. For this reason,
                        organizations often create both short-(monthly or quarterly) and long-term (annual) budgets,
                        where
                        the short-term budget is regularly adjusted to ensure the long-term budget stays on track.</p>

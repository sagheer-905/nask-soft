      <p>The person responsible for generating a budget varies depending on an organization's nature and
        its budgetary goals. An entrepreneur or small business owner, for example, is likely to prepare
        an organizational budget on their own. Meanwhile, a larger organization may rely on a member of
        the accounting department to generate a budget for the entire business.
        Individual department heads or functional leads might also be called on to submit budget
        proposals for their teams.</p>

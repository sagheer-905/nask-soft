      <p>The first step is to calculate how much money you have coming in each month. This might be
        investment income, government assistance, student loans, employment income, disability benefits,
        retirement pensions or money from other sources.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-md-5">
      <h3 className="h5 text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4">2. Set goals</h3>
      <p>Next you need to determine how you spend your money by reviewing your financial records. If your
        records aren't clear, consider keeping a financial diary to track your spending. Be sure to
        separate the fixed expenses that you must meet (mortgage, rent, car payments,</p>

    <div className="col-md-5">
      <h3 className="h5 text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4">3. Pay yourself first</h3>
      <p>Once you've figured out how much money is coming in and where it's going, you can put together a
        plan that matches your goals with your financial situation.</p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-md-5">
      <h3 className="h5 text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4">4. Determine your expenses</h3>
      <p>Establish a list of the goals you wish to achieve. These can be long-term goals like purchasing
        property or funding your retirement
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className="col-md-5">
      <h3 className="h5 text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4">5. Create a plan</h3>
      <p>When you pay yourself first you simply set aside a certain amount of money each month to go into
        an account that you will not touch. You can set up a separate savings account for infrequent but
        anticipated expenses, such as property taxes, vacations, automobile insurance or car
        maintenance. Our JumpstartÂ® is specially designed for these types of savings plans.</p>

    <div className="col-md-5">
      <h3 className="h5 text-uppercase fw-bold mb-4">6. Track your progress</h3>
      <p>At the end of each month, you should re-evaluate your budget. Compare your actual expenses and
        income to your budget and make appropriate adjustments. Once your budget is done, things are
        bound to change. They always do. So stay flexible. And remember, a budget is only a guideline.
        It doesn't factor in nonfinancial considerations.</p>
